title: "Defining and Monitoring Postgres instances on Azure"
---

To monitor a Postgres Instance running on Azure using PEM:

1. Create a `Postgres` instance on Azure. For more details visit [Microsoft Website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/quickstart-create-server-database-portal)

    Go to Azure portal, search and create `Azure Database for PostgreSQL Servers`. 

1. Register the `Postgres` instance on your PEM Server.

   After creating a `Postgres` instance on Azure, use `Create - Server` dialog to add the `Postgres` instance to the PEM Server. Using this dialog you can describe a new server connection, bind the server to a PEM Agent, and display the server to the PEM browser tree control.

   For detailed information on the `Create - Server` dialog and configuration details for each tab, see [Registering a Server](02_registering_server/#registering_server).

   The `PEM Agent` tab in the `Create - Server` dialog must have the `Remote Monitoring` field set to `Yes` to monitor the `Postgres` instance on Azure using PEM Server.

   As the PEM Agent will be monitoring the `Postgres` instance remotely, the functionality will be limited as described below:

   | Capacity Manager             | Limited                     | There will be no correlation between the database server and operating system metrices.                                                                                               |

   | Manage Alerts                | Limited                     | When you run an alert script on the database server, it will run on the machine where the bound PEM Agent is running, and not on the actual database server machine.                  |

   | Manage Probes                | Limited                     | Some of the PEM probes will not return information, and some of the functionalities may be affected. For details about probe functionality, see the [PEM Agent Guide](../pem_agent/). |
   | Postgres Expert              | Limited                     | The Postgres Expert will provide partial information as operating system information is not available.                                                                                |
   | Postgres Log Analysis Expert | No                          | The Postgres Log Analysis Expert will not be able to perform an analysis as it is dependent on the logs imported by log manager, which will not work as required.                     |
